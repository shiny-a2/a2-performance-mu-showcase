# Security

Security and resilience controls include:

- Endpoint allowlisting for internal API access patterns.
- Rate limiting to protect critical endpoints from bursts and abuse.
- Reduced exposure by serving snapshot data where real-time mutation is unnecessary.
- Least-privilege operational workflows for maintenance tasks.
- Secret material and infra credentials managed outside repository scope.

No source code or environment secrets are included here.
